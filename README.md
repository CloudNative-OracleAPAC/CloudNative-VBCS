## Building Web & Mobile App without Coding!

### Introduction
When coding classes are commonly taught from Grade One, and the machine processing power is no longer a critical path to most computer programs, the art of computer programming has transcended from “writing an impeccable piece of code” to “realizing an innovative idea in the context of machine”.  Welcome to the era of programming without coding. Take a ride with us through the Oracle autonomous journey, and experience how the elements of autonomous can be applied in the domain of Application Development.

The center showpiece here is the Oracle Autonomous Visual Builder Cloud Service, which provides an easy way to create and host web and mobile applications in a secure cloud environment. It offers an intuitive visual development experience on top of a complete development and hosting platform, which accelerates the entire cycle of application creation and provisioning, while it leverages an open, standard-based architecture
