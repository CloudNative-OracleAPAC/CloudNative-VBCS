# ORACLE Cloud Test Drive: Autonomous Visual Builder Cloud Service

## Building My First Mobile App

### Introduction
The basic components of a visual application are mobile applications, web applications, service connections, business objects, and processes.

The basic building blocks of a mobile or web application are user interface (UI) components, variables, action chains, page flows and page navigation, and data access through REST endpoints.

## What are you going to build
In this hands on lab you will be building a Simple HR Mobile application that features Employees, Departments and Locations.
We will be re-using the Business Object Model of the earlier build web application. If you skipped the previous lab exercise you can download the completed MyFirstApp and import this into your VBCS environment.

You can download the application here:
